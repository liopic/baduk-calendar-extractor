# baduk-calendar-extractor

## Concept
In the Hankuk Kiwon website there is [a page with information](http://baduk.or.kr/info/schedule.asp) about the incomming baduk (Go) tournaments and events
for the current month, but it can be requested
for [other months](http://baduk.or.kr/info/schedule.asp?nowYear=2017&nowMonth=07) too.

This code has the intention to extract the information of each event, translate it, and format in a way it can be
easy to import in a calendar app.

The code will try to extract for each event:
* Day and start time
* The name
* The number of round, of final phase
* The players (in some cases, the highlighted match)
* The place

## Code (WIP)
The code is being developed in Python, as a practice. If you find anything that could be improved, please let me know.
